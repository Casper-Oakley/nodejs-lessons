\begin{frame}{Setting up your development environment}

We will be using  version: v6.9.5 (with npm version 3.10.10)

\begin{itemize}
  \item {
    Windows: \textbf{https://nodejs.org/en/download/}
  }
  \item {
    Mac OSX: \textbf{https://nodejs.org/en/download/}
  }
  \item {
    Linux: Either \textbf{sudo apt-get install nodejs} or \textbf{https://nodejs.org/en/download/}
  }
\end{itemize}

If at any time you get stuck, just stick your hand up.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Setting up your development environment}
You will also need a text editor. The choice of text editor is up to what you feel most comfortable using.
\pause
Some options include:
\begin{itemize}
  \pause
  \item notepad++
  \pause
  \item Vim
  \pause
  \item GNU Emacs
  \pause
  \item atom \pause - Fun fact, this was actually written in part in NodeJS!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The basics of NodeJS}
NodeJS is an extremely powerful language developed on top of the V8 javascript engine, written by google.
\pause
It operates on a single thread, using an event loop to manage concurrency.
\pause
It has been found to be particularly strong in certain areas:
\pause
\begin{itemize}
  \item I/O bound applications \pause
  \item Data streaming applications\pause
  \item JSON APIs\pause
  \item As the backend in a MEAN stack web app \pause - This is the one we will focus on
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Running NodeJS code}

Two ways to run your NodeJS code:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Through the command line interpreter (the REPL)
  \item By putting your code into a file and executing the file
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{NPM: node package manager}

NodeJS's strengths lie mainly in it's ability to route information from places to other places, not to do heavy computation/store data/render stuff.
\pause
The Node Package Manager (NPM) sources all kinds of packages for NodeJS, each of which can be installed in one simple command!
\pause
\textit{https://www.npmjs.com/}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{That's all for tonight!}
  To summarise:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We have installed Python and PyCharm
  \item We have learnt about variables and variable types
  \item We have learnt about printing and asking for input from the user
  \item We have made a sweet ass calculator!
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{For next week}
Source code plus lecture slides will be available online soon after the lesson.\\
